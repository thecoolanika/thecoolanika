About Me

Hi there! I'm Anika Pandey, a first-year Computer Science student at Harvey Mudd College. I'm passionate about programming and am eager to learn and explore the vast world of computer science.

Technical Skills

I'm currently focusing on developing my skills in the following areas: C++, Machine Learning

Programming Languages: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Matlab, Racket, Lisp
Projects

I'm actively working on personal projects to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience. Here are a few of my recent projects:

FindAuthor: A pseudo-ai project that scans a document and matches its writing style with a set of certain authors
Tetris: A Java program that implements a simple game of tetris
ToDoList: A web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive to-do list.

I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers. I'm currently exploring repositories and seeking ways to make meaningful contributions.

Learning and Growth

I'm committed to continuous learning and growth in the field of computer science. I regularly participate in online courses, attend workshops and computer science events such as hackathons, and read technical articles to expand my knowledge and skills.
